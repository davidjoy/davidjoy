# Hey there 👋

My name is David.

I've been writing software for quite a while now.  I primarily work in web applications, and in the past 5-6 years have been on a deep dive of the JavaScript ecosystem.  

## 📌 Pinned Repos

These are some open source libraries and applications I've worked on at edX over the past few years.  They're good examples of some of my professional work, and are core modules of the Open edX Platform.

## 📖 Public Repos

The public repositories here are primarily teaching materials that I've shared with my coworkers over the years.  I've taught folks about ES6, Webpack, React, Redux, and a programming fundamentals with Ruby class once upon a time.

## 🕵🏼 Private Repos (shhh)

The private repositories here are various attempts at 2D game design. I discovered some time ago that I learn by doing. I've learned a lot about programming trying to make these games. I'm currently working on a game called Myth, a pure JavaScript 2D overhead RPG written in React, Redux, and Phaser.  

Prior attempts have involved:

- Godot
- Unity
- Electron
- Groovy and Grails
- Express/Sequelize
- Django/Python
- Various JS canvas libraries
- You name it.  

Sometimes they have servers, multi-player, and/or map editors.  I'd be happy to gush about them, it's been a wonderful learning experience.  I've never quite gotten myself to just make it all public.  Maybe I should. 🤷🏼‍♂️
