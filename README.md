# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is David.

I've been writing software for quite a while now.  I primarily work in web applications, and in the past 10 years have been on a deep dive of the JavaScript ecosystem.  

## ðŸ“Œ Pinned Repos

These are some open source libraries and applications I've worked on at edX over the past few years.  They're good examples of some of my professional work, and are core modules of the Open edX Platform.  You'll also see the Lyceum Games "Venture" platform, which is a JavaScript-based storytelling platform I've been writing for a number of years.

## ðŸ“– Public Repos

The other public repositories here are primarily teaching materials that I've shared with my coworkers over the years.  I've taught folks about ES6, Webpack, React, Redux, and a programming fundamentals with Ruby class once upon a time.
